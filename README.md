# What I want with Noblivion

My objective is to replace all propietary Productivity apps out there like (Notion, Todoist, Google Calendar, Microsoft Todo, evernote) and combine all the productivity activities and tools into one single specification and also application. I also want Noblivion being agnostic to the application allowing the community implement their own client, improving and agilizing the development process.

I also want to make this specification as easy and human possible being able to edit the files of the productivity system manually with a text editor without neglet the automation part.

# Features that I want to add to Noblivion

- Todos Notes: with
    - short descriptions. (could be eliminated)
    - long descriptions integrated with the notes part or adjunts files.
    - reminders.
    - due dates.
    - repeatable tasks.
    - renewable task (not in the specification but in the client)
    - tags and properties.
    - child todo.
    - dependencies between todos (optional)
- Calendar events
- integrated notes

# Specifications

- (Todo specs)[specs/todo.md]
- (Directory and references)[specs/directory structure and references.md]
- (datetime and datetime functions format)[specs/datetime and datetimes functions format.md]

# Feedback and roadmap

I really would love listen your opinion about this project, how do you think it can be improved or what can change.

I am going to work in this project in my free time. so the development could not be as fast as desired. the things that I am going to work on are:

1. A c library covering this complete specification; in c for its interoperability with other languages.
2. A CLI tool or tools for linux, windows and mac on top of the c library.
3. And if the things goes well, a simple android application. (optional)
