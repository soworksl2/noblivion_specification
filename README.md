# What I want with Noblivion

My objective is to replace all proprietary productivity apps out there, such as Notion, Todoist, Google Calendar, Microsoft Todo, and Evernote. I aim to combine all productivity activities and tools into one single specification and application. Additionally, I want Noblivion to be agnostic to the application, allowing the community to implement their own client, improving and streamlining the development process.

Furthermore, I aim to make this specification as easy and human-friendly as possible, enabling users to edit the files of the productivity system manually with a text editor without neglecting the automation part.

# Features that I want to add to Noblivion

- Todos Notes: with
    - short descriptions. (could be eliminated)
    - long descriptions integrated with the notes part or adjunts files.
    - reminders.
    - due dates.
    - repeatable tasks.
    - renewable task (not in the specification but in the client)
    - tags and properties.
    - child todo.
    - dependencies between todos (optional)
- Calendar events
- integrated notes

# Specifications

- [Todo specs](specs/todo.md)
- [Directory and references](specs/directory_structure_and_references.md)
- [datetime and datetime functions format](specs/datetime_and_datetimes_functions_format.md)

# Feedback and roadmap

I really would love to hear your opinion about this project. How do you think it can be improved or what can change?

I am going to work on this project in my free time, so the development may not be as fast as desired. The things that I am going to work on are:

1. A C library covering this complete specification; in C for its interoperability with other languages.
2. A CLI tool or tools for linux, windows and mac on top of the C library.
3. And if the things go well, a simple android application. (optional)
